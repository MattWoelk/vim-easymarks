# Introduction

EasyMarks provides a much simpler way to use marks in vim.

When the user uses the ' or ` key, all marks show up on screen. The user
can then hit the key of a mark's name to jump to that mark.

# NOTES

This plugin does NOT yet work. Do not think that it does. This is a work in progress.
